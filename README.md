# 2D-Portfolio Project

Welcome to my 2D-Portfolio Project! This creative endeavor is a reflection of my journey as a self-taught software engineer. Inspired by a tutorial from FreeCodeCamp, this project is a testament to the power of learning and the joy of building something from scratch.

## Tutorial Details

The tutorial for this project was provided by FreeCodeCamp. You can watch the tutorial video on their YouTube channel. (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy_fSStEgMs>) 

## Project Description

This portfolio is a dynamic 2D representation of my skills and projects. It's designed to be interactive, engaging, and a unique way to showcase my work. The project is built with a blend of technologies that I've mastered over time, ensuring a robust and visually appealing experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For structuring and styling the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: To bring interactivity and dynamic content to the portfolio.
- **Vite**: A build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **Markdown**: Utilized for documentation and easy content management.

## Installation and Setup

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the portfolio.
